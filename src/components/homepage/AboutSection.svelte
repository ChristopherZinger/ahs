		<p>
			Did you ever find yourself working weekends, to make an unrealistic deadline that your project
			leader came up with half drunk on a Friday evening?

			<br />
			Or polishing the piece of plywood model until 4am, just so your boss can forget to take it to the
			final presentation?

			<br />
			<br />
			Would you sign up for this job if you saw all the red flags up front?
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s not a secret that on the interview you won’t get true insights of the office. Interviewer
			won’t tell you about:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Unpaid overtime they require every day</li>
			<li>That the position you applied for, won’t give you any valuable experience</li>
			<li>How one of the team leaders likes to tell sexist jokes during lunch.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			I want to build this webpage for people like you. Architects who are tired of being lied to
			and taken advantage of. To make it happen I need your help. Raise all red flags that you would
			like to know about before you started working in a particular office.
			<span style="color: red"> Give me your best architecture horror story! </span>
